# noaa-testing
I have been studying dsp on my own, but long before I ever started down this path I thought this would be a cool project to work on. For now, the goal is to decode wav files from the NOAA-19 satellite into pictures of the Earth. Long term, I would like to switch away from using python for this. Probably looking at c++, but thats only once I get it working in python.
# maybe in the future
* map lines
* false coloring
* other satellites
